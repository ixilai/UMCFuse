# UMCFuse: A Unified Multiple Complex Scenes Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Framework

![Workflow](https://github.com/ixilai/UMCFuse/blob/master/liucheng.jpg)

UMCFuse is a **unified framework** for **infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF)** in **complex scenes**, including haze, rain, snow, overexposure, fire, and noisy environments. The framework effectively integrates multi-modal information, preserves fine details, suppresses noise, and enhances scene understanding for downstream tasks such as **object detection**, **semantic segmentation**, and **salient object detection**.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Unified Framework for Complex Scenes**  
  Handles multiple challenging environmental conditions within a single model, eliminating the need for scene-specific tuning.

- **Transmission Map Guided Decomposition**  
  Estimates **light transmission** for robust separation of contrast and structure layers, improving fusion quality in adverse conditions.
